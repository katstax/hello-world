Introduction to github

Greetings All!

My name is Katlego and I'm a third year Electrical Engineering student at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. My main area of interest is access automation and control and I'm fascinated by remote-controlled exit/entry points, traffic-control barriers, biometrics and things of that nature. Outside of my work, I really an easy going fellow with a passion for music, travelling and all things that make life worthwhile.

My goal for this week is to get the IDE, compiler and libraries - googletest and sfml up and running. I also want to get going with Github and start interacting with my lab partner.
